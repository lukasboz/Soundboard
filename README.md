# Soundboard
This program launches a simple GUI that can play different audio files out to the speakers of your device by clicking on the respective sound's button. 
This is currently a work-in-progress. 
Future improvements include:
-> Ability to add and remove your own files without having to modify actual code
-> Ability to play sounds through your microphone for others to hear
-> Voice changers and other voice-modifying effects
